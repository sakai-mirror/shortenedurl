# this defines the entity description for the SHortenedUrlService
url=An entity provider to allow shortening of URLs via the ShortenedUrlService

url.action.shorten=Shorten a given URL using the configured implementation. \nThe URL should be passed in via the 'path' URL parameter and should be URL encoded. \nIf you want to use the 'secure' method (RandomisedUrlService only), also pass it as a URL parameter and use true|false as the value. \nNote that by default, for security reasons, external URLs cannot be shortened. If you want to allow this, set shortenedurl.external.enabled\=true in sakai.properties.
